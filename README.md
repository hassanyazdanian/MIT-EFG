Abstract of the paper:
Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) is a modality for imaging the electrical conductivity of biological tissues. This paper presents a hybrid finite element-element free Galerkin (FE-EFG) method for solving 2D MIT forward
problem. The numerical implementation of the hybrid method is validated by an analytical problem. A 16-coil 2D MIT system is modeled and the hybrid method is employed to solve the forward problem using a head phantom. The results hold promise for alternatively employing of the hybrid FE-EFG method in situations with meshing task problem.
